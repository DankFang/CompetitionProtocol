Competition protocol is an infrastructure to create on-chain events and secret ballets quickly, using ZK snarks technology to provide anonymous voting.

Competition protocol([original version][pre]) started from the [Eth Hong Kong Hackthon][hackthon hk] Otc. 2023 and won the second prize. Now, it is rebuilt by yarn and other features.
